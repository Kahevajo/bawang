Universal react application for the chapter website.

##Running

`npm run server:dev` will start the whole universal server in development mode. Use this to make sure the universal nature of the application is kept intact.

`npm run client:dev` will start development server for just the frontend. This also enables hot reloading which is nice for frontend development.

`npm run server:prod` will build and start a production ready server.

##TODO
- Frontpage
- News page
- Add english support, since there is english content now
- Cache fetched content for a while?
- Add more content providers, i.e. skywhale, pandora
- Write a more helpful README
